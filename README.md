# WeatherApp
Simple app uses [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) api
## Why
This app was created just to learn how to consume a web api, but while I was writing it I learnt a couple things like json models,
managing http requests etc. So feel free to use app parts as an example for your own needs.
## What it does
Gets a `.json` repsonses from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) about current weather or a forecast. If location is not specified - application 
will use a client ip-address to know where it is via [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/).
